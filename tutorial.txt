-The objective of the game is to move your ball
 into the goal.

-Movement consists of the four 
 directions: north, south, east, and west.

-When you move, your ball will roll until it
 hits a non-empty tile, typically a wall.

-Each map is limited to 40 spaces wide by 20
 spaces high, but the play area might be smaller.

-In the main menu, you have the option of starting
 a new game at level 0 or level 1, or entering in
 a password to jump to a specific level.

-Reaching the goal takes you to the next level
 and prints a password to the screen for that level.

-The folder for this game should include this tutorial,
 the program's code and executable, a solution file,
 and each individual map and a map template so you can
 make you own!


--------------------------------------------

O = You. Each time you move, this symbol will continue in
     the same direction until it hits something.

| = Side walls of the map.

- = Top and bottom walls of the map.

* = The goal. Your objective is to move your ball onto
     the spot where this is in order to progress in the game.

+ = Spikes. Touching these from any side will kill you
     and will reset the map.

NOTE: Filled in squares are boxes, which act like walls from
      all directions. Notepad does not use the symbol so I
      cannot show you here but it looks like a box (b).

--------------------------------------------

/ = Bumper (NW-SE). Running into them from the south will deflect
     your path to the east and vice versa, and running into
     them from the north will deflect your path to the west
     and vice versa.

\ = Bumper (NE-SW). Running into them from the south will deflect
     your path to the west and vice versa, and running into
     them from the north will deflect your path to the east
     and vice versa.

--------------------------------------------

V = Move tile (down). Running into this tile forces you down
     regardless of which direction you ran into it from.

< = Move tile (left). Running into this tile forces you left
     regardless of which direction you ran into it from.

> = Move tile (right). Running into this tile forces you right
     regardless of which direction you ran into it from.

^ = Move tile (up). Running into this tile forces you up
     regardless of which direction you ran into it from.

NOTE: These are not the same as in game because notepad does
      not use the symbols for them. They do look similar however.

--------------------------------------------

@ = Teleport. Running into this from any direction takes you to
     the only other teleport on the map and continues you in your
     original direction.

H = Move-through gate (vertical). Running into them from the sides
     will stop you like a wall, but moving into them from the top or
     bottom will allow you to continue normally.

I = Move-through gate (horizontal). Running into them from the top
     or bottom will stop you like a wall, but moving into them from
     the sides will allow you to continue normally.

# = Net. Running into it will stop you on it. You can then move from
     its location. The net will disappear after use.

NOTE: You can cause an infinite loop by allowing the player into a
      teleporter that sends them into another teleporter. Test your
      maps to make sure this is not ever possible.

--------------------------------------------

s = Switch. Step on these to remove all barriers from the map. You can
     then move from its location.

X = Barrier. These act like boxes and can be removed by stepping
     on a switch.

NOTE: The symbol for the switch is actually more like a gear; it
      is a small circle with six spikes.
